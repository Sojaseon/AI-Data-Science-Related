    "# Searching\n",
    "Searching algorithms are used to find a specific element or value within a collection of data. There are several types of searching algorithms, such as linear search, binary search, and hash-based search.\n",
    "Linear search is a simple searching algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a collection until a match is found or the end of the collection is reached. Binary search, on the other hand, is a more efficient algorithm that works on sorted collections. It repeatedly divides the collection in half and narrows down the search space until the desired element is found. Hash-based search algorithms utilize a hash function to store and retrieve elements from a data structure called a hash table."

    "# Dynamic Programming\n",
    "Dynamic programming is a technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems. It stores the solutions to subproblems in a table or memoization array to avoid redundant computations and optimizes the overall problem solution.\n",
    "One classic example of dynamic programming is the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci numbers are calculated using the recursive formula F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1. Dynamic programming can be applied to efficiently calculate Fibonacci numbers by storing the results of already computed subproblems."
